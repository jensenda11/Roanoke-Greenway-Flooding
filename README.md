# Roanoke-Greenway-Flooding
A simple little python script that tells you if the Roanoke greenway has been flooded. Great to run before you go on a bike ride. 
##

This python script will compare the current height of the Roanoke River with the
height of the lowest bridge on the Roanoke River greenway. River height is obtained
by accessing online usgs stream gauge data, so an internet connection is required
for this script to run. Have a good bike ride!
