# Roanoke-Greenway-Flooding
A simple little python script that tells you if the Roanoke greenway has been flooded. Great to run before you go on a bike ride. 
##

As anyone in SW Virginia will tell you, the Roanoke River loves to flood and spill over onto the greenway. As a cyclist, your rides can be ruined by a nagging doubt: Will I be unable to cross a greenway bridge due to flooding and have to turn back in a foul mood? Soothe such doubts with this python script! It compares the current height of the Roanoke River with the height of the lowest bridge on the Roanoke River greenway. Simply run the script from the command line and it will print out information on greenway conditions. River height is obtained by accessing online USGS stream gauge data in the Roanoke River (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/va/nwis/uv?site_no=02055000), so an internet connection is required for this script to run. Have a good bike ride!
